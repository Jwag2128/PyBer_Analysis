# PyBer Analysis – Module 5 Challenge
## Overview 
### Pyber is a ride-sharing company that has enlisted our help.  The task was to analyze ride-sharing data from 2019.  This analysis is meant to show the correlation between city type and average fare per ride.  We were asked to display the results for each city type to show Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares, as well as Average Fare per Ride and per Driver.  We were also given a key list of dates to show the Total Fare by City Type.
## Results
### The results of the first step in the analysis showed that the Urban market was flooded with drivers and there was not enough ride demand.  This caused there to be a very low average fare per ride and per driver as the total number of rides was much less than the driver count.  The Rural market had the highest Average fare per ride and per driver but the lowest number of drivers and rides.

### The results of the second step showed the total fares within a 4-month period in 2019 from January 1st – May 28th.  These results were displayed by City Type.  This showed once again that the Urban market had the highest amount of total fares and the Rural market had the lowest.  The graph also highlighted the end of February - beginning of March as a dip in fares across all 3 markets.

## Summary
### In summary, this analysis can support several recommendations to help the business.
•	Reducing the driver count in the Urban market to match the demand.  Keeping too many drivers on who aren’t working can lead to customer issues as well as frustrate good drivers who can’t pick up enough fares to make driving worth it.
•	The Rural market had the highest averages in both fare and by driver but the lowest driver count.  There might be more demand but not enough drivers.  Increasing marketing and driver count in this area might boost business.  The average fare should stay stable as these customers seem to be taking longer rides.
•	The time period at the end of February – beginning of March should be compared to other years to see if the same dip happens.  Those results can be used to determine if more drivers are needed during that time period or does the demand shift.  Addressing this period can help grow the business.
